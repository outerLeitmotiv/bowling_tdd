# Bowling Scorekeeper - TDD Exercise

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to a university project that explores Test-Driven Development (TDD) through the creation of a simple bowling scorekeeper application. The project emphasizes the TDD methodology, where tests are written before the implementation code to guide the development process.

## Components
- `Roll`: Defines a bowling roll with the number of pins knocked down.
- `Frame`: Represents a standard frame in bowling, tracking up to two rolls.
- `TenthFrame`: Handles the tenth frame's unique rules, allowing for a potential third roll.
- `Game`: Manages the game's logic, including score calculation across frames.

## TDD Approach
The development of this project strictly follows the TDD principles:
1. **Write a Test**: Start with a test that defines a desired improvement or new function.
2. **Make it Run**: Implement the minimum amount of code required to make the test pass.
3. **Refactor**: Clean up the new code, ensuring it fits well with the existing architecture.
